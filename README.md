# 🌟 Thandar Kyi — Data Analytics Portfolio



Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio.

Here I showcase selected projects demonstrating my skills in time-series forecasting, statistical modelling, data exploration, and reproducible analytics workflows using tools such as SAS, R, Python, SQL, and GitHub.



My work reflects a strong analytical background built through postgraduate studies at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and hands-on experience across data-driven academic and applied projects.



## 📁 Featured Projects



#### 🔹 1. Electricity Demand Forecasting — Auckland



**Tools**: SAS (GLM, ESM, PLM), Time-Series Modelling



A comprehensive forecasting study modelling hourly electricity consumption in Auckland’s North Island.

The project analyses load patterns, seasonal cycles, and temperature-related effects to produce reliable short-term forecasts.



**Includes**:



* Regression with hour-of-day seasonal effects
* Holt-Winters (additive) exponential smoothing
* Full residual diagnostics

🔗 **Code**: electricity-forecasting/scripts/



#### 🔹 2. Auckland House Price Index Forecasting (STEM Research Project)



**Tools**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels), Time-Series \& ML Modelling



A research-driven forecasting project analysing the Auckland House Price Index (HPI) using ARIMA, ARIMAX, and macroeconomic drivers such as mortgage rates, migration, and building consents.

The study evaluates model accuracy across multiple forecast horizons and explores policy / regime effects (AUP \& pandemic periods).



**Includes**:



* Data preprocessing, imputation, and panel construction
* Cross-validation (1, 3, 6, 12-month rolling forecasts)
* ARIMA \& ARIMAX modelling with external economic drivers
* Forecast accuracy comparison using RMSE, MAPE, DM tests
* Test-period evaluation and horizon-wise winner models

#### 🔹 3. Flood Warning Prediction — Auckland (Machine Learning Project)



**Tools**: Python (TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn), ML Modelling \& Deep Learning



A binary classification and regression project predicting flood risk and river water levels for the Manukau Harbour region.

The project compares traditional machine learning methods with deep learning architectures to improve early flood warning capability.



**Includes**:



* Data cleaning \& exploratory analysis
* Feature engineering and correlation study
* Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
* Deep Learning models: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), LSTM
* Model evaluation using accuracy, AUC, loss curves
* River-level forecasting and flood classification

## 🎯 About This Portfolio



This repository serves as a central, version-controlled space for my analytics work.

Each project includes:



* A structured README.md
* Code scripts (SAS / Python)
* Figures \& visualisations
* Full project report
* Organised directory structure



As I continue to build my skills, more projects will be added and existing ones refined.
