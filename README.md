# 🌟 Thandar Kyi — Data Analytics Portfolio



Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio.

Here I showcase selected projects demonstrating my skills in time-series forecasting, statistical modelling, data exploration, and reproducible analytics workflows using tools such as SAS, R, Python, SQL, and GitHub.



My work reflects a strong analytical background built through postgraduate studies at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) and hands-on experience across data-driven academic and applied projects.



## 📁 Featured Projects



#### 🔹 1. Electricity Demand Forecasting — Auckland North Island



Tools: SAS (GLM, ESM, PLM), Time-Series Modelling

A comprehensive forecasting analysis of hourly electricity demand to understand load patterns, seasonality, and short-term operational forecasting.

Includes: Regression with hourly effects, Holt-Winters models, diagnostics, and 7-day forecasts.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio



This repository serves as a central, version-controlled space for my analytics work.

Each project includes:



* A clear README.md
* Code scripts (SAS / R / Python)
